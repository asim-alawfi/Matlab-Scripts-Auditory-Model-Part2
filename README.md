# Matlab-Scripts-Auditory-Model-Part2
These scripts perform one-parameter bifurcation for the auditory model using DDE-Biftool (for the case where different values for tone duration (TD) and delay (D) are considered).
They should be run in sequence, as each script ends with a `save(...)` command and the next script begins with a `load(...)` command.

Once all the scripts have been executed, the results (figures) can be generated by running the script `plot_one_parameter_for_all_caes.m`, which will produce the necessary figures. 

Essential first steps to run the scripts: 
1. From the repository called **Matlab-Supporting-Functions-for-Auditory-Model**, download the MAT files `sol23_j.mat` and `sol23_j3.mat`. 
2. The first script to be run is `br_of_POs_different_values_TD_D_in_loop.m`.
